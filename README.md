## This works but many parameters are guessed as of now ##

Works on deb files of Zoom, Neofetch, Ripgrep and Galculator

## What is this? ##

This is a Python Program that I made to make it easier to install deb packages in Solus. 

## Why bother? ##

I love Solus, but I don't want to rely on Flatpaks or Snaps for software that are not in the repos because of theming and other personal reasons

## Will you support RPM? ##

I don't plan to because it is common that the rpm package that you want to install already has a deb counterpart. (Besides, there is alien for you)

## Is it a replacement for Solbuild? ##

Of course it's not!
